# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project focuses on building a Python-based machine learning system to predict the presence of heart disease using patient clinical data. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, handling missing values, feature scaling, and exploratory data analysis to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Multiple classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest are implemented using Scikit-learn. The models are trained and evaluated using standard performance metrics including accuracy and confusion matrix to compare their effectiveness. Data visualization is performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to better understand feature relationships and model behavior.

This project serves as a learning exercise in applied machine learning and data-driven decision making in healthcare.
